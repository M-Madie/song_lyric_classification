# Song Lyrics (Text) Classification Project

This repository contains one of my projects as a data science student taken from my student repo (copy of finalized files), in it i developed an NLP based model that classifies lyrics as belonging to one of two artists (Britney Spears or 50-Cent).

The data was scraped from the web (process for one of the artists is shown in the notebook).

The repository includes the following files:
Task_Titanic - an exploration of the titanic data set
Task_titanic_model - a logestic regression prediction model
Task_titanic_pipiline - a script for running the model on the data set
